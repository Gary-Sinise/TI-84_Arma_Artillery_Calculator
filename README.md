# TI-84_Arma_Artillery_Calculator
 An artillery calculator for Arma 3 coded in TI-Basic for the TI-83/84 calculators. Additional support for N-Spire calculators may come in the future. 
 This is also my first time using GitHub, so bare with me for a bit.
 This is a big work in progress.
 
 If you find it useful tell me about because that would be cool.
 If you share it with other people then please credit me. You don't have to do that, but that would be kinda cool.
